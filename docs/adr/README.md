# Architecture Decision Records — InvoFi (app monorepo)

ADRs capture decisions with lasting consequences. New ADRs get the next number;
append, never rewrite (status updates go in the file).

Contract-facing decisions live in the contracts repo: [invofi-contracts/docs/adr](https://github.com/Stellar-VaultLink/invofi-contracts/blob/master/docs/adr/README.md).

## Why ADRs

- Reviewers (and the SCF audit bank) can see *why* a choice was made without
  digging through commit history.
- Future contributors get a decision map instead of tribal knowledge.
